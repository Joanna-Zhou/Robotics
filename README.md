- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results.

## Projects

### 1. A* Path Finding
- Implementation of the A* algorithm for pathfinding in a grid environment. The algorithm finds the shortest path from a start point to a goal point.
- **Files**: `AStar-Path-Finding.py`

### 2. Bayesian Localization
- Implementation of a Bayesian filter for robot localization. The algorithm estimates the position of the robot based on sensor measurements and movement commands.
- **Files**: `Bayesian-Localization.py`

### 3. Extended Kalman Filter
- MATLAB implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter for nonlinear state estimation. Used for tracking and localization applications.
- **Files**: `Extended-Kalman_Filter.m`

### 4. Constraint Search Problem
- Solving constraint satisfaction problems using various search algorithms. Applied to different robotics scenarios.
- **Files**: `ConstraintSearchProblem/`

### 5. Pacman Game AI
- Implementation of AI algorithms to control Pacman's movements in the game. Algorithms include pathfinding and decision-making strategies.
- **Files**: `Pacman/`

### 6. Sokoban Game AI
- AI solutions for solving Sokoban game puzzles. Focuses on optimal moves to solve the puzzles efficiently.
- **Files**: `SokobanGameAI/`
